# Fraud_detection
End to end data analysis project using  MySQL Workbench and Tableau
# Financial Fraud Detection Analysis 🕵️‍♂️💸

## Project Overview
This project focuses on identifying fraudulent financial transactions using data analytics. By leveraging **MySQL** for data processing and **Tableau** for visualization, I have created a system to detect anomalies and high-risk patterns in banking data.

## Features & Analytics 📊
- **Anomaly Detection:** Identified transactions that deviate significantly from average customer behavior.
- **Geospatial Analysis:** Visualized fraud cases across different regions to find 'hotspots'.
- **Temporal Trends:** Analyzed time-based patterns (e.g., midnight transactions) that often correlate with fraud.
- **Customer Segmentation:** Grouped customers based on risk profiles using SQL filtering.

## Tech Stack 🛠️
- **Database Management:** MySQL Workbench (Complex Queries, Joins, CTEs).
- **Visualization:** Tableau (Interactive Dashboards, Dual-axis charts).
- **Dataset:** [Mention Source, e.g., Kaggle/Sample Bank Data].

## Key Insights 🔍
- Detected a 12% increase in fraudulent attempts during late-night hours.
- Identified that 65% of fraud cases occurred in specific high-risk merchant categories.

## Project Structure
- `SQL_Scripts/`: Contains all queries used for data extraction and cleaning.
- `Tableau_Workbook/`: The `.twbx` file for the interactive dashboard.
- `Dataset/`: Raw and processed data files.
